# Topic: **Policy Search in Decision Making**

## Purpose:
- Researching Section 10: Policy Search at page 235/700 from the book -Algorithms for Decision 
  Making. 
- We focus on researching the content and the working principles of the algorithms, techniques, 
  and models presented in this section, as well as their role in decision-making and 
  significance.
- Additionally, we implement illustrative programs for the algorithms (alternative optimization).

##
"Algorithms for Decision Making" by Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Tim A. Wheeler, and Kyle H. Wray is an academic book that provides a comprehensive introduction to algorithms used for decision-making under uncertainty. It combines concepts from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decision Theory, and Optimization to address sequential decision-making problems.

## Policy Search
Policy Search is an important method in Decision Support Systems (DSS), especially in Reinforcement Learning (RL). When the state space is large or continuous, calculating the value for each state through a value function becomes complex. Instead, Policy Search optimizes the policy space directly without computing the value function for the entire state space, reducing complexity.
    - Parameterized Policy: Representing the policy in a parameterized form makes optimization 
      easier, as the policy space is smaller than the state space.
    - Gradient-free Search Methods: These are used when estimating the gradient is difficult, 
      helping to avoid local optima and explore the policy space more effectively.

## Six alternative optimization in Policy Search:
   - Approximate Policy Evaluation
   - Local search
   - Genetic Algorithm
   - Cross-Entropy Method
   - Evolution Strategies
   - Isotropic Evolutionary Strategies
